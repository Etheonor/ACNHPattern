      <h2>How did you build it?</h2>
      <p>
        With great software! I'm new to web development and I wanted to improve
        my skills by building something fun, and something that I liked. I used{" "}
        <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">GatsbyJS</a>, a cool framework based
        on React that let you build fast modern static websites{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        I also used <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a> for the
        database and the authentication system, and it was a breeze, especially for someone
        who was afraid of all the server side stuff of a website.
